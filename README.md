# MASS - Micro Architecture Simulator Suite

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

**MASS (Micro Architecture Simulator Suite)** is an interactive educational platform for exploring processor microarchitecture concepts. It provides a **RISC-V Pipeline Simulator** and a **Cache Simulator**, enabling students, educators, and researchers to visualize instruction flow, memory access, and pipeline behavior in a step-by-step, interactive environment.

## **Live Demo**

You can try MASS online here:  
- **RISC-V Pipeline Simulator:** [Launch](https://risc-v-cpu-visualizer.vercel.app/)  
- **Cache Simulator:** [Launch](https://cache-visualizer.vercel.app/)

---

## **Features**

- **RISC-V Pipeline Simulator**:  
  - Visualize instruction execution across stages.  
  - Observe pipeline hazards, stalls, and forwarding mechanisms.  
  - Step-by-step simulation for learning and teaching.

- **Cache Simulator**:  
  - Explore memory hierarchy and cache behavior.  
  - Understand cache hits, misses, and replacement policies.  
  - Interactive visualization for memory access patterns.

- **Responsive Design**:  
  - Works smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.  
  - Clean and professional UI with cards, modals, and hover effects.

- **Contact Form**:  
  - Users can reach out directly through a modal contact form.  
  - Emails are sent via EmailJS with a professional template.

## **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5** – Structure and content of the web pages.  
- **CSS3** – Styling, responsive design, hover effects, and modals.  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Interactivity, modal handling, form submission, EmailJS integration.  
- **EmailJS** – Sending emails directly from frontend without a backend.  
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** – Layout and responsive design.  
- **Vercel** – Deployment and hosting of static site.  
- **System Fonts & Icons** – UI enhancements and visual clarity.

## **Usage**

1. **Access the Simulators**  
   - Open `index.html` locally in a browser or access the live Vercel deployment.  
   - The homepage displays two main simulators:  
     - **RISC-V Pipeline Simulator**  
     - **Cache Simulator**  

2. **RISC-V Pipeline Simulator**  
   - Click **Launch** to open the simulator.  
   - Step through instructions to visualize pipeline stages.  
   - Observe hazards, stalls, and instruction flow.  

3. **Cache Simulator**  
   - Click **Launch** to open the cache simulator.  
   - Visualize memory access patterns and cache behavior.  
   - Explore hits, misses, and replacement policies interactively.  

4. **Contact & Feedback**  
   - Click the **Contact Us** button in the footer.  
   - Fill in your name, email, subject, and message.  
   - Messages are sent directly via EmailJS.  

5. **Responsive Design**  
   - MASS adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.  
   - Cards, modals, and text resize automatically for optimal viewing.
